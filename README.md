# **Car Checkin Tool**

We, [Jordy Fronik](https://github.com/joordy), [Lars Ruijs](https://github.com/lars-ruijs) & [Guus Maij](https://github.com/tsjuusmei) have made an application to check-in reservations for rental cars online. Because of this, the user will only have to physically pick-up the keys for the car, and will shorten the queue at the rental place.

## üöÄ **Live demo**

You can visit the project [here](https://car-checkin-tool.netlify.app/)

## üìÑ **Debrief**

A reservation is, most of the time, made well ahead of the rental date. Until now, the user always has to check-in physically at the location of the rental, which easily costs about 15 minutes per user.

Create a digital check-in process for the rental service, so that there is only little time needed to physically pick up the rental car. The check-in process consists of: user login, checking in a reservation, confirm the identity and driver's license and create a reservation for the deposit on a creditcard.

## ‚úçüèº **Design Challenge**

How can we ensure that customers, that reserved a car at the rental, can easily check-in online, so that they can quickly pick up the reserved car at the relevant location.

## üî¶ **Features**

-   User login
-   Overview of reservations
-   Checking in a reservation
-   Confirming identity and driver's license
-   Reserve deposit on a creditcard

## üõ† **API / Externals**

<details style="margin: 1em 0;">
  <summary style="margin: 1em 0;">Stripe Identity API</summary>

To confirm the identity and driver's license of the user(s), we use [Stripe Identity API](https://stripe.com/docs/identity). This service easily can easily the identity and driver's license for us.

<details style="margin: 1em 0;">
  <summary style="margin: 1em 0;">Stripe API</summary>

To assure the reserve deposit on a creditcard, we use [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api).

</details>

<details style="margin: 1em 0;">
  <summary style="margin: 1em 0;">Passslot</summary>

To add a checked-in reservation to a user's Apple Wallet, we use [Passslot](https://www.passslot.com/developer/api/resources).

</details>

## üìä **Database**

For the usage of the database, we chose [Supabase](https://supabase.io/). This is a very easy to set up database, which a very nice and easy documentation. Therefore this database seemed really easy to use, and we chose to use this for our project.

<details style="margin: 1em 0;">
  <summary style="margin: 1em 0;"><strong>Dataset</strong></summary>

For this project we needed to store the users and their reservations, with all of the associated information:

## üñ• **Tech-stack**

The application is built in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). This is a component based framework, where we can easily work in together.
For every feature or adjustment, we worked in branches and made pull requests of every small change or feature add-on. Every pull request must be reviewed by at least 1 of the other team members before it is able to merge onto the `development` branch.

We also used a method called [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). By using this, we split up every bit of code in `atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms` and `templates`. By doing this we can easily re-use components, and we have a clear overview of the components by size.

We also use [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) as code formatter, which also uses [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) to lint the code. This will save a lot of discussion within code reviews, because it creates the same layout for the code on every save the creator makes.
